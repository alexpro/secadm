Introduction
============

secadm is a project to replace the mac_bsdextended(4)/ugidfw(8)
integration the HardenedBSD project has done for ASLR, SEGVGUARD, and
PTrace hardening. The secadm project will be implemented as a custom
ports entry in the HardenedBSD/freebsd-ports repo. The port will
consist of three parts: a kernel module that integrates with the MAC
framework, a shared library that communicates between kernel and
userland, and an application that consumes the shared library.

The MAC module will work on a per-jail basis. It will communicate
with userland via a sysctl node. The MAC module should hook into the
execve() call to set per-process security/hardening flags, such as
toggling ASLR or SEGVGUARD. Each jail manages its own rules. Rules
applied in one jail do not interact or impact other jails.

The shared library will be named libsecadm and will simply act as a
communication layer between userland applications and the sysctl.
The shared library will perform the same sanitization and sanity
checking on all rule changes, including the removal of rules, that the
MAC module performs.

The userland application will be named secadm. It will consume libsecadm
and libucl. Rules will be written in json to allow for a
configuration file format that is readable and parseable by both
humans and machines. Using the json format will also allow for
additional flexibility and dynamic content. One can imagine secadm
deployed in a security appliance where the rulesets are created and
updated via a web service API.

secadm supports toggling ASLR, SEGVGUARD, PAGEEXEC, and MPROTECT
restrictions. As of version 0.2, secadm also introduces a new
Integriforce feature. Integriforce ensures executable file integrity
prior to execution.

Requirements
============

* HardenedBSD version 9 or greater:
  - `sysctl hardening.version` should show 9
* textproc/libucl

Installation And Usage
======================

# make
# make depend all install

To list which per-applicatin features your version of secadm supports:
# secadm list features

To load the secadm kernel module:
# kldload secadm

Edit your rules:
# vi secadm/config.conf.sample

Activate them. Please note that setting a new ruleset will flush your
previously-loaded rules.
# secadm -c secadm/config.conf.sample set

To verify that your ruleset loaded successfully:
# secadm list

To flush rules:
# secadm flush

Writing Application Rules
=========================

secadm currently supports toggling ASLR, SEGVGUARD, mprotect(exec)
hardening, and on certain HardenedBSD builds, PAGEEXEC hardening. In
the etc directory, you will find secadm.rules.sample, which shows
how to write rules.

secadm uses libucl for parsing its config file. As it stands right
now, the order of the rules do not matter, but that could change with
time as we add new features. The sample config file is in a relaxed
JSON format, though libucl supports different syntaxes. Please refer
to libucl's documentation for help in learning the different possible
syntaxes.

In the root object, secadm expects an applications array. Each entry
in the applications array must be an object. That object must have the
following fields:

	1. path (string): The fully-qualified path of the program
	2. features (object): An object that describes each of the
	   features we are toggling. Supported features:
	   a. aslr (boolean): toggles ASLR
	   b. segvguard (boolean): toggles SEGVGUARD
	   c. mprotect (boolean): toggles mprotect(exec) hardening
	   d. pageexec (boolean): toggles PAGEEXEC
	   e. shlibrandom (boolean): toggles shared object load order
	      randomization in the RTLD.

When you combine that all together, you should get the following
example. Let's say we want to force ASLR and SEGVGUARD off with
/bin/ls and force mprotect(exec) hardening and PAGEEXEC on with
/bin/pwd. This is what you would write:

==== Start of Example ====
{
	"applications": [
		{
			"path": "/bin/ls",
			"features": {
				"aslr": false,
				"segvguard": false
			}
		},
		{
			"path": "/bin/pwd",
			"features": {
				"mprotect": true,
				"pageexec": true
			}
		}
	]
}
==== End of Example ====

Integriforce
============

secadm version 0.2 supports a new feature, called Integriforce. This
feature provides executable file integrity enforcement. If a rule
exists for a given file, that file's hash as defined in the rule is
matched against the hash of the file. If the hashes don't match,
execution may be disallowed, depending on the configuration settings.
Integriforce is an optional, but powerful, feature. Integriforce
currently supports only SHA1 or SHA256.

NOTE: Files that are under Integriforce management cannot be modified
or deleted. The ruleset will need to be flushed prior to
modifying or deleting the file.

Configuring Integriforce
------------------------

In the root object of the configuration file, secadm will look for an
integriforce object. In the integriforce object, add a files array. In
the files array, place an array of objects, where each object contains
the following options:

	1. enforcing (string, default "hard"): If set, this must equal
	   either "soft" or "hard". Soft mode means execution is
	   allowed if hashes don't match, but a warning message is
	   printed. Hard mode prints an error messages and disallows
	   execution.
	2. files (array of objects): Each object must contain the
	   following fields:
		2.1. path (string): The path to the executable.
		2.2. hash (string): The hash (sha1 or sha256) of the
		     executable.
		2.3. hash_type (string): Either "sha1" or "sha256".
		2.4. enforcing (optional, string, default to inherit):
		     The enforcing mode for this file.

Note About ABI and API Stability
================================

Both the userland and kernel ABI and API are under heavy development.
Though care has been taken to keep future changes and features in
mind, the API and ABI are not stable and may change from release to
release. If you plan to develop third-party applications that consume
libsecadm, please do so at your own risk. If you feel you need added
features or a change to an existing feature, please file a bug report
at secadm's issue tracker on github.
